# WEB WHISPER

<p align="center"> <b> üé∂ Convert any audio to text üìù </b></p>

<br>

A user interface for OpenAI's [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) right into your browser!

This is a small personal project I am using to learn Golang and Svelte. It is a light web frontend for OpenAI's whisper.

    - Audio files are deleted immediately after processing.
- [x] Uses C++ whisper version from [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp).
    - You don't need a GPU, uses CPU.
    - No need for complex installations.
- [x] Backend written in **Go**
- [x] Lightweight and beautiful UI.
    - [x] Frontend written with **Svelte** and **Tailwind CSS**.

## üß≠ Roadmap:

- [ ] Transcription history / save snippets
    - Publish to some **pastebin**-like service.

## üß™ Test it!

You can easily [**self host**](https://codeberg.org/pluja/web-whisper/wiki/Self-Hosting) your own instance with docker (locally or in a server).

Also, I have made testing instance available at: https://whisper.r3d.red

Note that this instance is limited:
- Maximum of 10 seconds audio recordings 
- File uploads are disabled.
- Uses the `base` model.

## Other information

#### How fast is this?

Whisper.cpp usually provides faster results than the python implementation. Although it will highly depend on your machine resources, the length of the media source and the file size. Here is a little benchmark:

```
CPU: i7
RAM: 16
Threads: 4
Procs: 1
Input format: webm audio
File size: 7MB
Audio length: 30m

Total elapsed time: 7m 38s
```
```
CPU: i7
RAM: 16
Threads: 10
Procs: 1
Input format: webm audio
Audio length: 30s

Total elapsed time: 5s
```

- [Whisper WASM](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/tree/master/examples/whisper.wasm) - If you want to run Whisper directly in your browser without the need of a server, you can use this project. Note that performance for this version is not very good.
